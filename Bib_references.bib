The model incorporates carrier sense, non-saturated traffic and SNR, for both basic and RTS/CTS access mechanisms. Analysis of the model shows that the throughput first increases, and then decreases with the number of active stations, suggesting the need for an admission control mechanism. We introduce such a mechanism, which tries to maximize the throughput while maintaining a fair allocation. The maximum achievable throughput is tracked by the mechanism as the number of active stations increases. An extensive performance analysis shows that the mechanism provides significant improvements. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

In order to achieve this goal, several novel features are introduced in IEEE 802.11ah in both the Physical Layer (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) layer. These features have been extensively studied from various perspectives in the past years. To provide readers with an insight into these novel features, this article provides an overview of the IEEE 802.11ah technology and conducts a comprehensive summary and analysis on the related research, revealing how to utilize these novel features to satisfy the demanding IoT performance criteria. Furthermore, the remaining issues that need to be addressed to fully realize the vision of large-scale and low power Wi-Fi networks for the IoT are discussed.},

   abstract = {For dense wireless LANs (WLANs), IEEE 802.11ah has specified restricted access window (RAW) as the channel access scheme. Here the competing stations (STAs) are divided into groups and STAs belonging to each group attempt to access the channel during their designated RAW slot by invoking the distributed coordination function (DCF) protocol. This paper describes an analytical model to evaluate the throughput performance of IEEE 802.11ah WLAN, when STAs use distinct data rates and the RAW mechanism is implemented for medium sharing. When STAs are grouped randomly (i.e., without considering their data rates), a group will contain STAs operating at distinct data rates. Since all these STAs simultaneously contend for channel access based on DCF protocol, the throughput of high data rate STAs are down-equalized to that of lower data rate STAs; thus the aggregate network throughput is degraded significantly. To resolve the resulting performance anomaly problem, we consider data rate based grouping where STAs operating at the same data rate are grouped together. We describe an algorithm for implementing data rate based grouping at the access point (AP). Further, we describe an analytical procedure to find the network throughput under data rate based grouping. Through numerical and experimental investigations, we establish that data rate based grouping can significantly improve the aggregate network throughput performance, as compared to the conventional random grouping strategy. Further, we use Jain's fairness index (JFI) to establish that data rate based grouping can also provide fair resource allocation among the STAs operating at distinct data rates, by ensuring that all the competing STAs in the network achieve throughput proportional to their data rates.},

@article{,
   abstract = {So far, existing sub-GHz wireless communication technologies focused on low-bandwidth, long-range communication with large numbers of constrained devices. Although these characteristics are fine for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, more demanding application requirements could not be met and legacy Internet technologies such as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) could not be used. This has changed with the advent of the new IEEE 802.11ah Wi-Fi standard, which is much more suitable for reliable bidirectional communication and high-throughput applications over a wide area (up to 1 km). The standard offers great possibilities for network performance optimization through a number of physical- and link-layer configurable features. However, given that the optimal configuration parameters depend on traffic patterns, the standard does not dictate how to determine them. Such a large number of configuration options can lead to sub-optimal or even incorrect configurations. Therefore, we investigated how two key mechanisms, Restricted Access Window (RAW) grouping and Traffic Indication Map (TIM) segmentation, influence scalability, throughput, latency and energy efficiency in the presence of bidirectional TCP/IP traffic. We considered both high-throughput video streaming traffic and large-scale reliable sensing traffic and investigated TCP behavior in both scenarios when the link layer introduces long delays. This article presents the relations between attainable throughput per station and attainable number of stations, as well as the influence of RAW, TIM and TCP parameters on both. We found that up to 20 continuously streaming IP-cameras can be reliably connected via IEEE 802.11ah with a maximum average data rate of 160 kbps, whereas 10 IP-cameras can achieve average data rates of up to 255 kbps over 200 m. Up to 6960 stations transmitting every 60 s can be connected over 1 km with no lost packets. The presented results enable the fine tuning of RAW and TIM parameters for throughput-demanding reliable applications (i.e., video streaming, firmware updates) on one hand, and very dense low-throughput reliable networks with bidirectional traffic on the other hand.},

This work addresses the importance of energy consumption by proposing a new Medium Access Control (MAC) mechanism for improving the energy efficiency of IEEE 802.11ah, a standard targeting M2M communication. We propose to use the features of IEEE 802.11ah MAC to realize a hybrid contention-reservation mechanism for the transmission of uplink traffic. In the proposed mechanism, any device with a buffered packet will first notify the Access Point (AP) during a contention phase before being given a reserved timeslot for the data transmission. We develop a mathematical model to analyse the energy consumption of the proposed mechanism and of IEEE 802.11ah. The results show that for a monitoring scenario, the proposed contention-reservation mechanism reduces the energy consumption for a successful uplink data transmission by up to 55\%.

   abstract = {For the large scale wireless networks, restricted access window (RAW) mechanism is a promising technique for realizing large-scale sensor access with the limited collision probability. In this paper, we are committed to designing the traffic distribution based sensor grouping scheme to balance the energy efficiency (EE) of different groups in the large scale access networks. Specifically, by adopting the Markov chain model, we formulate the optimization problem of max-min EE by taking into account traffic demands with even distribution of different all groups, but the formulated problem is an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem. In order to solve the INLP problem, we propose an optimal traffic grouping algorithm (OTGA) by utilizing the branch-and-bound method (BBM) to accommodate for the congestion level among groups. Though the traffic demands of each group can be obtained from the traffic grouping scheme, different combination of heterogeneous sensors can generate the same traffic demands, which make it difficult to find the optimal solution of sensor grouping from the proposed traffic grouping scheme. Furthermore, a heuristic traffic-sensor mapping algorithm (HTMA) is presented to make the traffic demands of each group appropriate. Thus, the proposed scheme can achieve a sub-optimal performance with the individual EE. The numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

   abstract = {Minimizing the energy consumption is one of the main challenges in internet of things (IoT) networks. Recently, the IEEE 802.11ah standard has been released as a new low-power Wi-Fi solution. It has several features, such as restricted access window (RAW) and target wake time (TWT), that promise to improve energy consumption. Specifically, in this article we study how to reduce the energy consumption thanks to RAW and TWT. In order to do this, we first present an analytical model that calculates the average energy consumption during a RAW slot. We compare these results to the IEEE 802.11ah simulator that we have extended for this scope with an energy life-cycle model for RAW and TWT. Then we study the energy consumption under different conditions using RAW. Finally, we evaluate the energy consumption using TWT. In the results, we show that the presented model has a maximum deviation from the simulations of 10\% in case of capture effect (CE) and 7\% without it. RAW always performs better than carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) when the traffic is higher and the usage of more slots has showed to have better energy efficiency, of up to the 76\%, although also significantly increasing the latency. We will show how TWT outperforms pure RAW, by over 100\%, when the transmission time is over 5 min.},

 abstract = {This paper deals first with the relationship between the theory of probability and the theory of rational behaviour. A method is then suggested for encouraging people to make accurate probability estimates, a connection with the theory of information being mentioned. Finally Wald's theory of statistical decision functions is summarised and generalised and its relation to the theory of rational behaviour is discussed.},
